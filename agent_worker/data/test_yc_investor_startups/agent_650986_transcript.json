    "name": "Noah",
    "bio": "Noah is a 33-year-old angel investor (ex-staff engineer, 2x founder exit) with a $500k allocation this quarter. His thesis prioritizes AI (infra + applied), developer tooling (product-led growth, bottom-up adoption), and fintech (compliance-forward, clear revenue paths). Noah screens for: recent YC batches (S23+), active hiring signals, early traction (paying customers or credible pilots), concise problem statements, and clear links (website, careers, LinkedIn). He prefers US/EU time zones for hands-on support, and teams with technical founders who can ship quickly. Initial pass criteria: crisp positioning, plausible GTM, and ability to reach $1\u20133M ARR in 18\u201324 months. Secondary diligence: founder backgrounds (LinkedIn/GitHub), demo walkthroughs, pricing pages, and signs of ICP clarity. Goal today: identify a fintech company (Stripe-like or in financial services) on YC\u2019s directory to review in detail."
